Nitro Modules are highly efficient native modules exposed with a statically compiled binding layer to JSI.

## Installation

1. Install [react-native-nitro-modules](npmjs.org/react-native-nitro-modules) from npm:
  ```sh
  yarn add react-native-nitro-modules
  cd ios && pod install
  ```
2. Enable C++ <-> Swift interop in your Xcode Project
  1. Open your `.xcworkspace` in Xcode
  2. Click on your app's project on the left
  3. Go to **Build Settings**
  4. Search for **"C++ and Objective-C interoperability"** and set it to C++/Objective-C++ (`SWIFT_OBJC_INTEROP_MODE="objcxx"`)

## Usage

ðŸ¤”

## Platforms

### Cross-platform

Cross-platform native modules can be built with C++.
Any custom C++ types can be used and bridged to JS with minimal overhead.

JS <-> C++ type converters are statically generated ahead of time - no more dynamic lookups or runtime parser errors! ðŸ¥³

### iOS

iOS native modules and view components can be written either in pure C++, or pure Swift.
Thanks to Swift 5.9, Swift Nitro Modules [bridge directly to C++](https://www.swift.org/documentation/cxx-interop/) instead of going through Objective-C message sends. Woohoo, no more Objective-C! ðŸ¥³

### Android

Android native modules and view components can be written either in pure C++, or pure Kotlin/Java.
Thanks to fbjni, even complex types can be effortlessly bridged to Kotlin/Java with minimal overhead! ðŸ”¥
